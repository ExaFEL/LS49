Picking up project again.  Using a new approach.
For each Bragg spot, take F**2 = constant simulated profile.
Multiply by Icalc
Do this for all (4) spots on each image, so as to fit Gi.

This means I have to find a point where I have access to both the observed shoeboxes, and also a
shoebox corresponding to the "black" curve with partiality profile x spectral profile.  It has to be
the 2D shoebox, not 1D projection onto the energy axis.

Furthermore, I can do the local fitting to the background based on the profile.  i.e., don't use the
dials shoebox background; use a new fit.  Can use DIALS background model as a starting point.  Can
we get it from the DIALS shoeboxes?

Two other considerations:
performance
plotting to confirm correctness

Take what we have now in may25_just_get_scale_factors as a baseline.
...it is 1D, not 2D.
...baseline has already been subtracted off in the shoebox.
...the I(hkl) has already been computed but I have not confirmed it.
...the I(hkl)--what energy does it represent?  Is anomalous scattering included or just FP?

make_7122_intensities.py:
just do one thing:  export a pickled dictionary with 7122 eV intensities.

make_7090_7150_intensities.py:
more complex, figure the intensities for every miller index over the entire energy range,
specifically for the reduced form

plot_intensities.py:
just make sure the 7122 intensities are consistent with the range intensities

make_model_obs.py:
dump the entire model/obs database from dataX##.pickle into a single file.  This avoids
reprocessing 73 seconds each time we look at the model/obs fit.  Simple reformatting and expedience

may26_fit_Gi.py:
try to make sense out of having multiple reflections on one image.  Is there a common scaling factor?

AAACK! it seems that the model spectrum already has partiality x spectrum x Icalc, instead of
partiality x spectrum as I had thought.  We are going to have to go deep to see how the model
is calculated by gen_data_mpi, for deposition into the pickle files dataX##.pickle.

Looking at LS49/sim/util_partiality.  The main simulator seems to be using structure factors
calculated with mean_wavelength (per pulse), while the channel_pixels function (one call per eV step)
is running with energy_dependent_model=False, thus presumably no separate scattering curves for
oxidized or reduced iron, and set to the mean wavelength.  Checking now how anomalous is applied or not.
This is done within LS49/sim/util_fmodel, class gen_fmodel.  By default this takes the iron fp and fdp
at the input wavelength.

So it would seem a good test to see if there is better scaling fit if the correct intensities are
substituted for the default.  We can do this test.  Yeah but there's ambiguity in the code.  For
util_partility did I calculate Icalc just once at a single energy at the time of first import?
If so I may have lost the Icalc.  So need to investigate further, and possibly redo the dataX## calculation.
It would be sufficient if we could rerun the dataX##, and modify it to dump the Icalcs, and then verify
we get the same models in the dataX##.

OK, back up a bit.  Let's re-run the correlation between LSQ Gi and total flux, with the may26_fit_Gi.py script.
But this time do not include the extra factor of Icalc, since it is already pre-multiplied into the model.
Better.  At least there is a trend:  the higher the flux, the lower the Gi factor.  Looks good for now.

wrote the framework for a bugfix LSQ treatment:  may27_debug.py.  However, I can't run it yet because the model
is still contaminated with Icalcs, and those are of uncertain provenance due to my use of a global variable to
supply them.  It looks as if I'll have to rerun the calculation of dataX## first.

writing a new version, may27_gen_data_mpi.py.
Note on incident spectrum:  in the LS49/sim/util_partiality/sim_2smv class, the flux is treated as a tophat function
that averages the variable total flux from my LG36 simulator uniformly over the 7090-7150 range.  Great!

Now what about Icalc?
Modifying util_partiality.py (not yet tracked in git, should do it soon).
Set the confusing gsfall option to False.
Utilize new singleton sfall_7122 to create a unified set of F's to use for all models.
It's the same numerical values as in make_7122_intensities--in fact, update that script and write it
to a pickle file.

Problem fixed.  Have to generate the 7122 in space group P1 to feed to simtbx.
Park the fixes in util_partiality.py.

These new dataX##.pickle files are concatenated with new script make_model_obs_28.py
Then try to fit Gi's with may28_fit_Gi.py
OK, looks like we are in the right ballpark.  Gi LSQ fit seems roughly anticorrelated with total flux,
while fitting a constant Gi against the 3-5 separate HKL observations on each image brings model
and observation roughly into agreement.

Now focus on may27_bugfix.py, to fit the f' f" curve.
make a note.  The minimizer should report how many images went in to the calculation
with 962 images the curve looks just as bad as ever.  Wait till May 29 to get more data.

May 29
1856 images.  Still noisy, but less so.
2814, still no improvement.  I suspect the P1 vs C2 indexing issue.  On the dataX##:  How can we really prove that we are using the same Fcalc in ROI simtbx as we are Icalc in the Gi fit and downstream f' f" fit LSQ analysis?

Let's leave some breadcrumbs behind for Q/A
1) do trial run on one image only.
     set maxy to 1.
     libtbx.python ../modules/LS49/work_for_aca_lsq/may27_gen_data_mpi.py 0
     cc: [0.66, -0.27, 0.51, 0.85]
     millers: [(-1, -15, -16), (-3, -17, -15), (-7, -17, -11), (-9, -21, -10)]
     orig_idx  (1, -15, 16), (3, -17, 15), (7, -17, 11), (9, -21, 10)
2) visualize shoebox overlaid with original image.  Verify that C2 Miller indices are the same.
     edit json to point at local images and do this:
     dials.image_viewer idx-step5_MPIbatch_000000.img_integrated_experiments.json /net/dials/raid1/sauter/LS49_integ_step5cori/idx-step5_MPIbatch_000000.img_integrated.pickle.
The indices match.  Print out original index to data.pickle file just to be sure.

Should review the comparison with ground truth in work_pre_experiment/post5_ang_misset.py
Maybe I should use the postrefined orientation for LSQ fitting, rather than the dials fit.
Or what about just using the ground truth orientation?
tomorrow:
1) model_obs.pickle output has original image name. DONE.
2) now that we know which spots we are talking about, get simtbx to write out the Miller index and
   structure factor that it thinks it's using for the ROI.
   It would be great if these could be written to the dataxx.pickle. DONE
3) Now analyze the Gi model with may28_fit_Gi.  Modify the code to properly mode what we have done here,
   writing out the simtbx intensity.
   We seem to be off by a factor of 4.  Not sure why.  Something to do with expand to P1?

June 3.
Just finished re-running the partiality models for all images, on cori, with MPI:
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH -q debug
#SBATCH -N 4
#SBATCH -t 00:10:00
#SBATCH -J my_job
#SBATCH -L SCRATCH
#SBATCH -C haswell
#SBATCH -A m2859

srun -n 64 -c 4 libtbx.python ../modules/LS49/work_for_aca_lsq/may27_gen_data_mpi.py

Now put the new dataXX files into a single file: make_model_obs_28.py
72838 Bragg spots measured
7180 Unique Miller indices
make_7122_intensities.py:
make_7090_7150_intensities.py:
libtbx.python may28_fit_Gi.py

There are two outstanding questions right now:
1) Will the model curves be smoother if we go to a simulation granularity of 1 eV instead
of 2 eV?
2) why the factor of about 4?

may27_bugfix.py. No help so far.
Maybe the thing to do is to refine the per-image Gi after all.  Or figure out the factor of ~4 discrepancy.

First sort out the 1eV vs. 2eV granularity.  Do a second simulation in the work1eV directory
Hard code changes in util_partiality.py and may27_gen_data_mpi.py
June 8, 2018.
Waited 3 days, but the result is not qualitatively different.  The black model curves appear congruent (even though
numerical values differ.)

Next, try to investigate the structure factor intensities in greater detail--why the ratio of about 4?
Also, can we please make the red & black plots to already include the Gi factor, so they are mutually scaled? Yes,
at least this seems to work.  It is imperfect, but in the right ballpark.  Modifications are in may28_fit_Gi.py
